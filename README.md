# Simple Stock Data Visualization App Using the Streamlit Library 

This is a simple stock data visualization app built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications with minimal effort.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a web app that allows users to visualize the closing price and volume data of various stocks. The app provides a text input where users can enter a ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) and see the corresponding historical stock data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install yfinance streamlit pandas
```

### Running the App

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py  
```

Replace `app.py` with the name of your main Python script.

4. Your default web browser will open, and you'll be able to interact with the app.

## Features

- Users can input a ticker symbol to view closing price and volume data.
- Default value is set to the S&P 500 index with custom display name.
- Data is fetched using the yfinance library and visualized using Streamlit charts.

## Further Enhancements

Here are some ideas for further enhancing the app:

- Add additional visualizations such as candlestick charts, moving averages, or technical indicators.
- Allow users to choose different time periods (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 1 year) for historical data.
- Implement error handling for cases where the input ticker symbol is not valid.
- Improve the UI/UX by adding more descriptive text and styling.
